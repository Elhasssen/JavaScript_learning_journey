// Use an Array to Store a Collection of Data
// All arrays have a length property, which as shown above, can be very easily accessed with the 
// syntax Array.length. A more complex implementation of an array can be seen below. This is 
// known as a multi-dimensional array, or an array that contains other arrays. Notice that this 
// array also contains JavaScript objects, which we will examine very closely in our next section, 
// but for now, all you need to know is that arrays are also capable of storing complex objects.
// let simpleArray = ['one', 2, 'three', true, false, undefined, null];
// console.log(simpleArray.length);
// ----------------------------------------------
// Access an Array's Contents Using Bracket Notation
// The fundamental feature of any data structure is, of course, the ability to not only store data, 
// but to be able to retrieve that data on command. So, now that we've learned how to create an array, 
// let's begin to think about how we can access that array's information.
// let ourArray = ["a", "b", "c"];
// ourArray[1] = "not b anymore";
// Using bracket notation, we have now reset the item at index 1 from the string b, to not b anymore. 
// Now ourArray is ["a", "not b anymore", "c"].
