// Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable
// The console.log() method, which "prints" the output of what's within its parentheses to the 
// console, will likely be the most helpful debugging tool. Placing it at strategic points in your 
// code can show you the intermediate values of variables. It's good practice to have an idea of 
// what the output should be before looking at what it is. Having check points to see the status of 
// your calculations throughout your code will help narrow down where the problem is.
// console.log('Hello world!');
