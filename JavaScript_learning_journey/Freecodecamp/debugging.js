// Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable
// The console.log() method, which "prints" the output of what's within its parentheses to the 
// console, will likely be the most helpful debugging tool. Placing it at strategic points in your 
// code can show you the intermediate values of variables. It's good practice to have an idea of 
// what the output should be before looking at what it is. Having check points to see the status of 
// your calculations throughout your code will help narrow down where the problem is.
// console.log('Hello world!');
// ------------------------------
// Understanding the Differences between the freeCodeCamp and Browser Console
//  There are many methods to use with console to output messages. log, warn, and clear to name a few.
// The freeCodeCamp console will only output log messages, while the browser console will output all 
// messages. When you make changes to your code, it will automatically run and show the logs. The 
// freeCodeCamp console is then cleared each time your code runs.
//------------------------------------------------
// Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable
// You can use typeof to check the data structure, or type, of a variable. 
// This is useful in debugging when working with multiple data types. 
// console.log(typeof "");
// console.log(typeof 0);
// console.log(typeof []);
// console.log(typeof {});
// JavaScript recognizes seven primitive (immutable) data types: 
// $Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, Symbol (new with ES6), and BigInt (new with ES2020), 
// and one type for mutable items: Object. Note that in JavaScript, arrays are technically a type of 
// object.
